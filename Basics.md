# Synthetic Image Generation With GANs - Basics and Background

<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>The Artificial Intelligence is the capability of a computational system to mimic the human intelligence by performing tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision-making. It is a branch of computer science that deals with developing methods and software that enables machine to perceive the environment, learn, and take an action in a way that maximises the chances of achieving the defined goals.  </p>

<p>Few traditional goals of AI to list: 

<ul> <li>Reasoning</li> <li>Planning</li> <li>Natural Languague Processing</li> <li>Perception</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Timeline of developments in the field of AI:

<ul> <li>1956: Found as an academic discipline</li> <li>2012: Rapid progress in the research of AI with the introduction of GPUs to accelerate neural network calculations</li> <li>2017: Acceleration of growth with the introduction of Transformer architecture</li>

<li>2020s: AI boom - introduction of generative AI that is able to generate synthetic data which looks unbelievably real</li></ul>
</p>

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

<p>The Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the study of statistical algorithms. These algorithms can analyze and learn the patterns from the data and generalize these patterns over unseen data to perform a certain task without explicit instructions. It involves training the models on the data to identify patterns and make predictions about the future events.  </p>

<p>Few machine learning algorithms that are in use for supervised learning:
<ul> <li>Linear Regression</li> <li> Logistic Regression</li> <li>Nearest Mean</li> <li>K-nearest neighbour</li> <li>Neural Networks</li> <li>Support Vector Machine</li> <li> Decision Tree</li> <li>Random Forest</li></ul>
</p>

<p>A few applications of machine learning:
<ul> <li>Banking</li> <li>Healthcare</li> <li>Computer vision</li> <li>Fraud detection</li> <li>Predictive analytics</li></ul>
</p>

<h2>Deep Learning</h2>

<p>The deep learning is a subset of machine learning that works stacking of artificial neural networks to learn the patterns or features in the data. The term <i>Deep</i> indicates that stacking of multiple layers, generally ranging from three to hundreds or thousands of layers in a network. This framework is inspired from biological central system where it is centered across stacking of several layers of neurons and training them with the data.</p>

<p>Some common deep learning architectures:
<ul> <li>Fully connected dense neural network</li> <li>Convoutional neural networks</li> <li>Recurrent neural networks</li> <li>Transformers</li> <li>Generative adversarial networks</li></ul>
</p>

<p>A few applications of deep learning:
<ul> <li>Computer vision</li> <li>Speech recognition</li> <li>Natural language procesing</li> <li>Medical image analysis</li></ul>
</p>

<h2>Generative AI</h2>

<p>The generative AI (Gen AI) is a subfield of AI that uses generative models to produce images, videos, and data formats. These models identify the patterns from the data provided during training and create synthetic data from these extracted patterns. Few models can manipulated the output by considering text commands from the user in the form of natural language prompts.</p>

<p>Several tools that make use of Gen AI:
<ul> <li>Chatbots: ChatGPT, CoPilot, Grok, Gemini</li> <li>Text-to-image models: Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E</li> <li>Text-to-video models: Sora</li> </ul>
</p>

<p>Besides being technically advanced, these models come with serious threats to the society. These models can be used to manipulate or deceive the receivers in the form of deepfakes. Strict regulations need to be introduced to restrict the misuse of these models and improve the authenticity or correctness of the data published.</p>

<p>A few applications of Gen AI:
<ul> <li>Software development</li> <li>Healthcare</li> <li>Art work</li> <li>Product design</li></ul>
</p>

<h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2>

<p>A GAN is a prominent machine learning framework for approaching Generative AI. The concept was developed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. It consists of 2 neural networks and work based on zero-sum game. The working methodology of GAN can be imagined analogous to a scenario where police catching a fraudster for faking something. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, a GAN consists of two networks: Generator and Discriminator. The generator network creates synthetic data from input signal i.e. noise. The discriminator is trained to validate real vs fake samples using supervised dataset. The generator learns about the hints used by the discriminator to validate the synthetic data and based on the feedback i.e. loss value, the generator enhances its output. At some point of time, generator gains the ability to create a perfect synthetic output where discriminator misinterprets it as a real sample. </p>

<p>The limitation with initial versions of GAN: data generation by generator part of the GAN is uncontrollable. This feature is regulated with later variants.</p>

<p>A few applications of GAN:
<ul> <li>Image recovery in medical field</li> <li>Malicious tasks</li> <li>Fashion, Art, and Advertising</li> </ul>
